	* gdk/x11/gdkglfont-x11.c
	(gdk_gl_font_use_pango_font_common): Check for null return values
	from pango_x_font_map_get_font_cache and pango_x_font_cache_load.
	From A C G Mennucc <mennucc@users.sourceforge.net>

2009-03-10  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

	Revert the 2009-03-07 change that removed the notions of
	"interface age" and "binary age" and instead fix this logic to
	bring it to parity with what modern GTK+ does.

	* configure.ac: Reinstated GTKGLEXT_INTERFACE_AGE,
	GTKGLEXT_BINARY_AGE, LT_RELEASE, LT_CURRENT, LT_REVISION, LT_AGE,
	and LT_CURRENT_MINUS_AGE.  Note that GTKGLEXT_BINARY_AGE is now
	computed from GTKGLEXT_MINOR_VERSION and GTKGLEXT_MICRO_VERSION.

	* gdk/gdkglversion.h.in

	Removed installed M4 macros for detecting the library.  pkg-config
	should be used for this purpose.

2009-03-09  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

	Updated viewlw example to use GtkFileChooserDialog instead of the
	deprecated GtkFileSelection.  The examples now compile with GTK+
	2.14 using GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.

	Require at least GTK+ 2.4.  While strictly this isn't necessary
	since we only need this 2.4-dependent feature in an example, GTK+
	2.4 is an old enough release at this point that there seems little
	potential harm in requiring it.

	* configure.ac: Bump minimum required GTK+ version to 2.4.0.
	* examples/viewlw.c
	(filew_ok): Removed.
	(select_lwobject): Create, run, and destroy the
	GtkFileChooserDialog.

2009-03-07  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

	Removed the broken logic that translated notions of an "interface
	age" and a "binary age" to Libtool library versions.  The Libtool
	library versions for libgdkglext and libgtkglext are now set
	directly in configure.ac.  Note also that the Libtool library
	versions for these libraries can (and generally should) be updated
	independently of eachother.

	For now, the Libtool library versions for both libgdkglext and
	libgtkglext have been reverted to their values as of the 1.0.6
	release of GtkGLExt.

	* configure.ac: Removed GTKGLEXT_INTERFACE_AGE,
	GTKGLEXT_BINARY_AGE, and LT_RELEASE.  LT_CURRENT, LT_REVISION,
	LT_AGE, and LT_CURRENT_MINUS_AGE have been split into separate
	variables applying to libgdkglext and libgtkglext.
	* gdk/Makefile.am: Use libgdkglext-specific variables.
	* gdk/gdkglversion.c: Removed gdkglext_interface_age and
	gdkglext_binary_age.
	* gdk/gdkglversion.h.in: Removed preprocessor definitions
	GDKGLEXT_INTERFACE_AGE and GDKGLEXT_BINARY_AGE along with variable
	declarations gdkglext_interface_age and gdkglext_binary_age.
	* gtk/Makefile.am: Use libgtkglext-specific variables.
	* gtk/gtkglversion.c: Removed gtkglext_interface_age and
	gtkglext_binary_age.
	* gtk/gtkglversion.h.in: Removed preprocessor definitions
	GTKGLEXT_INTERFACE_AGE and GTKGLEXT_BINARY_AGE along with variable
	declarations gtkglext_interface_age and gtkglext_binary_age.

2009-03-06  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

	* configure.ac: Removed redundant usage of AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0 and
	AM_PATH_GTK_2_0.

2008-05-06  Ralf Cors√©pius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	* gdk/Makefile.am, gdk/win32/Makefile.am, gdk/x11/Makefile.am
	gtk/Makefile.am: s/INCLUDES/AM_CPPFLAGS/.
	* configure.in: Remove check for indent.
