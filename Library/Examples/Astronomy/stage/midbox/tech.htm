</CENTER><P>CyberAstronomy was created with Cosmo Worlds 1.0. Textures were created in Photoshop 3.0. CyberAstronomy explores the use of spacial relationships and relative distances between the planets with VRML 2.0.  Planet models show scale, distance, and planetary rotations, though some creative license was taken due to spatial constraints.  All moons shown in CyberAstronomy orbit their respective planets at the correct relative speeds and are in proper orientation. CyberAstronomy also utilizes other VRML 2.0 features such as: spatialized audio, anchors to HTML links, and keyframe animation.  Level of Detail (LOD) was used to enhance performance, thereby keeping the detail on distant planets to a minimum, while enhancing planets closer to the viewpoint. CyberAstronomy uses visibility sensors and proximity sensors for optimization reasons.</P>
