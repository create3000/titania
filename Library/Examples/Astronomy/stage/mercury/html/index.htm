Mercury is the eighth largest planet (or second smallest) in the Solar 
System. 
<LI>
Mercury is a heavily cratered planet, composed of rock with a central 
iron core that is three-quarters of the diameter of the planet (3,600 
km). Following the Earth, Mercury is the second densest planet in the 
Solar System. 
<LI>
Covered with thousands of craters, the surface of Mercury closley 
resembles the Earth's Moon. Mercury has few non-cratered areas on the 
surface, with the exception of the large flat area known as the Caloris 
Basin, and a few other small areas. The Caloris Basin, the result of an 
asteroid impact, is 1300 km in diameter. 
<LI>
The surface temperature of Mercury is characterized by major 
fluctuations. The daytime side of the planet reaches over 400 degrees C 
(752 degrees F), but on the night side the temperature falls to -170 
degrees C (-274 degrees F). 
<LI>
Mercury has no atmosphere and no known satellites. 
<LI>
The only visit to Mercury was made by the Mariner 10 spacecraft in 
1974. 
<LI>
Mercury was believed by the Greeks to be two different stars. Mercury's 
appearance in the morning was called Apollo, and its evening appearance 
was referred to as Hermes. 
<LI>
Mercury, often identified with the Greek god, Hermes, is the messenger 
of the gods in Roman mythology. Mercury is often characterized with 
winged sandals.
