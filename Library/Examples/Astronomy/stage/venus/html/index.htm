Venus is the sixth largest planet in the Solar System. 
<LI>
Similar in size, density, and mass, Venus and Earth often referred to 
as sister planets. However the surface and atmosphere of the two 
planets are drastically different. 
<LI>
The atmosphere of Venus is primarily composed of carbon dioxide (96%) 
and nitrogen (3%), with traces of other gases and little to no water 
vapor. 
<LI>
Venus would have a cold climate if it weren't for the high 
concentration of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere (96%). The high 
albedo on Venus reflects the majority of the solar radiation that 
reaches it, but carbon dioxide, a well known greenhouse gas, keeps the 
planet extremely warm. In fact the surface temperature of Venus is over 
480 degrees C (900 degrees F). 
<LI>
The clouds in Venus' atmosphere are composed of sulfuric acid which 
causes the planet to reflect 65% of the sunlight that reaches it. Thus, 
Venus the third brightest object in the sky (third only to the Sun and 
the Moon). 
<LI>
The atmospheric pressure on the surface of Venus is that 90 times the 
pressure on Earth.. 
<LI>
The surface of Venus is very dry with flat plains, highland regions, 
and depressions. 
<LI>
The interior of Venus is composed of a central iron core and a molten 
rocky mantle, similar to the composition of Earth. 
<LI>
The rotation of Venus is very slow. A day on Venus (243 Earth days) is 
longer than a year (224.7 Earth days). The rotation is also opposite 
from that of Earth, with the Sun rising in the West. 
<LI>
Venus has been visited by over 20 spacecrafts. The first visit was made 
by Mariner 2 in 1962. The Soviet Venera 7, which visited Venus in 1970, 
was the first spacecraft to land on another planet. A recent visit made 
by the Magellan, launched in 1989, produced high resolution maps of the 
surface using radar. 
<LI>
Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
