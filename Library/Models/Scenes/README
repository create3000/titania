This directory contains collections of 3D geometric scenes.

File format is denoted by the suffix.
For example, files with `.iv' are IRIS Inventor format.

The .env files are environment files denote camera and light positions,
fog, etc. These are used by the SceneViewer program, which views
IRIS Inventor format files. For example:
SceneViewer -e chesschairs.env chesschairs.iv

IRIS Inventor Notes:
    . use `ivcat' to convert binary Inventor files to ascii
      (e.g. ivcat cube.iv)
    . use `ivinfo' to get a summary of an Inventor file contents
