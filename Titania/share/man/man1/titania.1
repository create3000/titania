.SH NAME

        titania - Titania X3D Editor

.SH SYNOPSIS

        titania [OPTIONS] [FILE]

.SH DESCRIPTION

        Titania is a X3D/VRML editor and browser for the Linux
        operating system. The goal is a full standard compliant X3D
        browser for future releases of Ubuntu. For now, Titania fully
        supports the Moving Worlds specification for VRML 2.0 and
        already many parts of the X3D specification.

        It can be used as a simple 3D viewer for .x3d files, as high
        quality 3D animation rendering engine, for advanced science
        simulations, live data visualization, or as easy to use
        gaming engine.

        Furthermore Titania can be used as X3D converter and beautifier
        for various file formats from the command line. It can format
        or convert a file to standard output or to your hard disk.

        Titania reads an X3D file and writes an indented, reformatted
        file. When no output file is specified the output is printed
        to stdout. Use the --style option to specify the desired
        output style.
