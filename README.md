[Titania](http://titania.create3000.de/) — Titania X3D Editor
==================================================

Introduction
--------------------------------------

Titania is a free, open source, specification conform X3D Graphics authoring tool and browser for Ubuntu. The goal is a 
full standard compliant X3D browser for future releases of Ubuntu. For now, Titania fully supports the Moving Worlds 
specification for VRML 2.0 and already most parts of the X3D specification.

It can be used as a simple 3D viewer for .x3dv/.x3d files, as high quality 3D animation rendering engine, for advanced 
science simulations, live data visualization, or as easy to use gaming engine.

Furthermore Titania can also be used as an easy to use X3D/VRML beautifier and converter.

Installation
--------------------------------------

### Ubuntu Package

Titania is available for all flavours of [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) on Launchpad via ppa. You can install Titania 
by pasting the following lines into a terminal: 

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:holger-seelig/titania
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install titania
```

### Standalone Debian/Ubuntu Packages

The latest stable [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and Ubuntu packages can be found at:

[https://launchpad.net/titania/+download](https://launchpad.net/titania/+download)


### Arch Linux User Repository

Since it is sometimes a bit tricky to compile titania successfully on other Linux systems than Ubuntu, there is a
package of the latest version of Titania available for AUR, the Arch Linux User Repository which should simplify the
process for you:

[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/titania-git/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/titania-git/)

They are specific for the [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) distribution. AUR Packages are not precompiled, they
are more or less simply a script that downloads the source code, installs all dependencies and executes the commands to
compile and install the software.

More information how to install an AUR package can be found at:

[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository)


### Install from Source

If you want to compile Titania from source, first make sure that all dependencies listed in `debian/control` are
installed. Then type the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/create3000/titania.git
cd titania
./autogen.sh
make -j4
make run
```

**Note:** `make -j4` compiles the project with four jobs at the same time, ie. it uses four processors. Adjust this 
value depending on the number of processors of your computer.  It can take 20 up to 45 minutes or longer to compile the
whole project.


Build Software
--------------------------------------
Titania is build with [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/), [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/) and Ubuntu.

Titania wouldn't be possible without parts of source code or inspiration from other software packages. We would like to 
say thank to everyone for their great work and help.
