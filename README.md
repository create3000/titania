Introduction
------------

Titania is a free, open source, specification compliant X3D Graphics authoring tool and browser for Ubuntu and other Linux systems. Of course, Titania fully supports the Moving Worlds specification for VRML 2.0, as it is a subset of X3D.

It can be used as a simple 3D viewer for .x3dv/.x3d files, as high quality 3D animation rendering engine, for advanced science simulations, live data visualization, or as easy to use gaming engine.

Furthermore Titania can also be used as an easy to use X3D/VRML beautifier and converter.
